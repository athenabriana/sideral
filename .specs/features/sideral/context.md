# sideral — Decisions

Discussion outcomes for ambiguities flagged in `spec.md`. Each row is the canonical answer for implementation.

## 1. Auto-update mechanism

**Decision:** Mirror bluefin's behaviour. **Verified: silverblue-main already ships `ublue-os-update-services-0.91`** as part of the base — no layering or extra COPR needed.
**Why:** User explicitly asked for "same bluefin behaviour". The package is already installed and its systemd timer is enabled by default in silverblue-main.
**Implementation:** Nothing to do. Just don't disable the existing service.

## 2. Desktop session

**Decision:** **Drop Hyprland entirely.** Desktop = GNOME Shell + tiling-shell (tiled-window management) + peer extensions (appindicator, dash-to-panel, rounded-window-corners). *(2026-05-01: bazaar-integration removed alongside the Bazaar→GNOME-Software swap; see decision #6 banner.)*
**Why:** User chose tiling-shell for simplicity over pop-shell / forge. GNOME is already the primary session in silverblue-main; tiling-shell layers a Windows-11-like snap-assist flow on top. Hyprland is redundant.
**Implementation:**
- Remove from `packages.txt`: hyprland, hyprpaper, hyprlock, hypridle, hyprpolkitagent, hyprcursor, hyprshot, xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland, rofi-wayland, wlogout, SwayNotificationCenter, astal*, aylurs-gtk-shell2, brightnessctl, playerctl, cliphist, grim, slurp, swappy
- Delete `home/.config/{hypr, ags, rofi, wlogout}` from the monorepo
- Delete `build_files/features/hyprland/` entirely

## 3. Repo rename

**Decision:** Rename repo folder `~/Code/sideral` → `~/Code/sideral`. Image name is `sideral`.

## 4. Default wallpapers

**Decision:** **Do not ship** defaults in `/etc/skel`. User supplies their own per machine.

## 5. Flatpak strategy

**Decision:** Mirror bluefin — Flathub remote enabled (inherited from silverblue-main) + systemd one-shot service auto-installs a curated list on first boot.
**Why:** User asked for "same bluefin behaviour for flatpaks". Keeps images reproducible while honoring "no hand-install after rebase".
**Curated list — current (post 2026-05-01 browser restore, 7 flatpaks):**
```
flathub/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal
flathub/io.github.flattool.Warehouse
flathub/com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager
flathub/io.podman_desktop.PodmanDesktop
flathub/com.ranfdev.DistroShelf
flathub/net.nokyan.Resources
flathub/it.mijorus.smile
```
**Browser:** Zen Browser (`app.zen_browser.zen` from Flathub) — 8 flatpaks total, all from Flathub. Preinstalled at image build by `os/build.sh`; updates via standard `flatpak update` — see decision #8 history below.
**Curated remotes (2):** `flathub`, `fedora` (oci+https://registry.fedoraproject.org). Registered system-wide at image build, persisted into the image via `/var/lib/flatpak/repo/config` (factory-seeded to deployed systems on first boot).
**History (7 → 8 → 7 → 8):**
- Originally 7: list above without a browser; browser was helium-bin RPM (decision #8 below).
- 2026-04-23: added `app.zen_browser.zen` flatpak when the COPR's `helium-bin` hit a `/opt/helium` cpio unpack conflict on a live Silverblue host (8 flatpaks).
- 2026-05-01 attempt #1: dropped `app.zen_browser.zen` and re-tried `helium-bin` from the same COPR (back to 7 flatpaks), betting that the OCI Containerfile build path would behave differently from `rpm-ostree install` on a live host. The bet lost — buildah hit the same `/opt/helium` cpio conflict (the COPR's RPM packages `/opt/` itself, conflicting with the existing directory regardless of install path). CI broke.
- 2026-05-01 attempt #2: dropped the COPR, shipped Helium as a local `.flatpak` bundle from `ShyVortex/helium-flatpak` GH Releases (manifest gained a `bundle <path>` line type). Reverted before merge: bundles have no remote → `flatpak update` can't refresh them, leaving the bundle install frozen between image rebases. (ShyVortex only ships release bundles; no ostree remote exists for that fork.)
- 2026-05-01 attempt #3: community `helium` Flatpak remote from `MarioGK/helium-flatpak` (mariogk.github.io GH Pages). Build broke at `flatpak install`: the descriptor URL is live but the deployed Pages repo is empty (only `summary` and `config`, no `objects/`, `refs/`, or `deltas/` — workflow reports success but produces an unusable repo).
- 2026-05-01 attempt #4: reused MarioGK's release bundle, inlined download+install in build.sh. Image built clean, but bundle install adds no usable remote (it points to the same broken Pages), so helium would only update at image rebuild cadence.
- 2026-05-01 attempt #5 (current): **dropped Helium entirely; reverted to Zen Browser from Flathub** — same `app.zen_browser.zen` ref used briefly between 2026-04-23 and 2026-05-01. Removes all packaging gymnastics: Flathub-hosted, GPG-verified, standard `flatpak update` flow. Trade: not actually Helium. After 4 failed attempts to ship Helium cleanly, the maintenance/trust cost outweighed the project's preference for it.
**Explicitly excluded:** Discord, Slack (comms), Pinta (creative), Stremio (media), DevToolbox, Ignition, Clapgrep, Impression, embellish, Evolution, Obsidian, Chrome, Chromium — all dropped on user request. Also tried-and-rejected: Zen Browser flatpak (used 2026-04-23 → 2026-05-01 only), Mozilla Firefox (briefly considered as helium replacement before Zen).

## 6. GNOME Shell extensions

> ⚠ **Bazaar→GNOME-Software swap, 2026-05-01.** App store moved from `bazaar` (ublue-os/packages COPR, GNOME-Shell-extension bundled) to `gnome-software` + `gnome-software-rpm-ostree` (Fedora main, ships in silverblue-main:43 base). Reasons: portability (gnome-software has no DE-specific shell extension dependency, so future non-GNOME variants would have an easier path), unified rpm-ostree-image-update + flatpak GUI surface, drops the `ublue-os/packages` COPR entirely from the image. `packaging-format-preference` dconf default makes flatpak the preferred format when an app is available in both. Bazaar flatpak (`io.github.kolunmi.Bazaar`) NOT re-added — clean break. The historical content below is preserved unchanged for posterity; live state is the post-swap layout.

**Decision:** Layer 3 via RPM + install 2 at image-build time + drop many others.

**Layer via RPM (Fedora main + ublue-os/packages COPR already enabled in silverblue-main):**
- `gnome-shell-extension-appindicator` (Fedora main — system tray)
- `gnome-shell-extension-dash-to-panel` (Fedora main — taskbar)
- ~~`bazaar` (ublue-os/packages COPR — bundles the Bazaar app + Shell extension + GNOME search provider)~~ **— removed 2026-05-01.** Replaced by `gnome-software` + `gnome-software-rpm-ostree` (Fedora main).

**Install at image-build time** from extensions.gnome.org (bluefin-style, option B): a script in `build_files/features/gnome-extensions/post-install.sh` that queries `extensions.gnome.org/extension-info/?uuid=<uuid>&shell_version=<N>` at build to resolve the latest compatible `.v<pk>.shell-extension.zip`, downloads it into `/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/<uuid>/`, compiles schemas with `glib-compile-schemas --strict`, and merges into the system schema cache. Build deps (`glib2-devel`) installed then removed in the same script.

Extensions installed this way:
- `tilingshell@ferrarodomenico.com`
- `rounded-window-corners@fxgn` (fxgn fork — not the older pixeledplay one)

Rationale vs the other options considered:
- **Not first-boot runtime install** (simpler but brittle — fails if offline on first boot)
- **Not git-submodule vendoring** (bluefin-exact but more repo complexity for 2 extensions)

**Drop:**
- `blur-my-shell` — user disabled it; no longer needed
- `awesome-tiles` — redundant with tiling-shell
- `zorin-menu` — Zorin-OS specific, doesn't belong on a Fedora image
- `tailscale@joaophi.github.com` — requires tailscale daemon; separate concern, defer
- `user-theme` — not needed by user
- `caffeine`, `dash-to-dock`, `gsconnect`, `logomenu`, `search-light`, `background-logo` — bluefin enables these; we skip

**Note on Bazaar duplication (historical, pre-2026-05-01):** since `bazaar` RPM included the app GUI, we dropped `io.github.kolunmi.Bazaar` from the flatpak manifest. After the 2026-05-01 swap, Bazaar is gone from the image entirely; the flatpak was NOT re-added (clean break). Final flatpak list remains **8 apps**.

**Pre-configured defaults:** Ship captured dconf settings as `/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-sideral-gnome-shell` (dash-to-panel icon/position, appindicator layout, rounded-corners radius, tiling-shell tiles config) plus `/etc/dconf/db/local.d/20-sideral-gnome-software` (`packaging-format-preference=['flatpak:flathub','flatpak','rpm']`, added 2026-05-01). Every user gets these defaults; they can override per-user.

## 7. Tailscale (deferred)

**Decision:** Defer to a later spec. Not in sideral P1-P3.

## 8. Package scope — surgical, not a full bluefin fork

**Decision:** Earlier intent to "add everything bluefin/bluefin-dx adds" was trimmed back after walking through individual packages. The final sideral layer is **surgical**: a short list of RPMs the user explicitly named + our sideral-specific extras. Bluefin's full FEDORA_PACKAGES list is **not** replicated.

> ⚠ **D-08 SUPERSEDED 2026-04-23.** The original RPM list below was trimmed in two waves. See live state in [STATE.md](../../project/STATE.md) "2026-04-23 cleanup" entry and [nix-home/context.md](../nix-home/context.md) D-04..D-15 for the new architecture. The historical content is preserved unchanged below for posterity.
>
> **Tracking summary** — what changed since this decision was written:
> - **Wave 1 (nix-home, NXH-01..40, ~2026-04 mid):** mise moved from RPM to nix; `sideral-mise-install.service` removed; `act`, `atuin`, `direnv` dropped from mise toolchain or moved to home-manager; `/etc/skel/.bashrc` replaced by home-manager-generated `~/.bashrc`.
> - **Wave 2 (RPM cleanup, 2026-04-23):** every plain-CLI moved to home.nix or removed:
>   - **→ home.nix**: `gh`, `starship`, `gcc`/`make`/`cmake`, `git-lfs`/`subtree`/`credential-libsecret`, `code` (VS Code).
>   - **→ flatpak (settled)**: `helium-bin` replaced by `app.zen_browser.zen` 2026-04-23 after a Silverblue `/opt` cpio conflict on a live host. 2026-05-01 churn — re-RPM via `imput/helium` COPR (same `/opt` conflict in buildah), `.flatpak` bundle from `ShyVortex/helium-flatpak` (no remote → no `flatpak update`), community `helium` Flatpak remote from `MarioGK/helium-flatpak` (Pages serves an empty ostree despite workflow success), MarioGK release bundle (works but no usable update remote). After 4 failed Helium packaging attempts, **dropped Helium and reverted to `app.zen_browser.zen` from Flathub** — the same swap that worked 2026-04-23. Standard Flathub install/update, no maintainer-trust gymnastics.
>   - **Removed entirely**: `nix-software-center` (snowfall fetch, never used), `android-tools` (use `nix shell` ad-hoc), kernel-debug stack `bcc`/`bpftop`/`bpftrace`/`sysprof`/`trace-cmd`/`tiptop`/`nicstat`/`iotop`/`udica` (bluefin-dx parity that the personal workload didn't need).
>   - **Feature dirs deleted**: `build_files/features/devtools/`, `build_files/features/browser/`.
> - **Net result:** RPM layer now contains GNOME shell extensions + bazaar + docker-ce stack + fonts only. Everything user-facing is home.nix or flatpak.
>   *(2026-05-01 update: bazaar replaced by gnome-software + gnome-software-rpm-ostree; net RPM count unchanged.)*

### RPMs to layer on top of silverblue-main *(historical — see banner above)*

**GNOME extensions (from Fedora main):**
- `gnome-shell-extension-appindicator`
- `gnome-shell-extension-dash-to-panel`

**App store (post-2026-05-01 swap, from Fedora main):**
- `gnome-software` — GTK4 app store, supports rpm-ostree image upgrades + flatpak install/update
- `gnome-software-rpm-ostree` — rpm-ostree backend plugin
- *(Was `bazaar` from `ublue-os/packages` COPR pre-2026-05-01; the COPR is no longer enabled in the shipped image.)*

**Dev tooling (user-approved surgical list):** ⚠ all moved to home.nix in 2026-04-23 cleanup
- ~~`gcc`, `make`, `cmake`~~ — now via `pkgs.gcc/gnumake/cmake` in `home.packages`
- ~~`git-credential-libsecret`~~ — now via `programs.git.extraConfig.credential.helper = "libsecret"` (uses nixpkgs git's libexec)
- ~~`git-subtree`~~ — bundled with `pkgs.git`, no separate install needed
- ~~`git-lfs`~~ — now via `programs.git.lfs.enable`

**Editor (VS Code — mirrors bluefin-dx pattern):** ⚠ moved to home.nix in 2026-04-23 cleanup
- ~~`code` from Microsoft's `packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode` repo~~ — now via `programs.vscode` in home.nix
- ~~`system_files/usr/lib/systemd/user/sideral-vscode-setup.service`~~ — service deleted; extensions now declared via `programs.vscode.extensions = with pkgs.vscode-extensions; [ ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh, ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers ]`

**Terminal:** Ptyxis (shipped by silverblue-main base) is the terminal. **Kitty dropped** — no layering, no dotfile.

**CLI (mise doesn't package it):** ⚠ moved to home.nix
- ~~`gh` — GitHub CLI~~ — now via `programs.gh.enable`

**Browser:** ✓ Zen Browser from Flathub (settled 2026-05-01 after Helium packaging failed 4 ways)
- Source: `app.zen_browser.zen` from Flathub. Standard listing, GPG-verified, maintained by the Zen project — no extra remotes, no maintainer-trust gymnastics.
- Mechanism: `os/build.sh` registers two system-wide flatpak remotes (`flathub`, `fedora` oci+registry) and runs `flatpak install --system` for every entry in `/etc/flatpak-manifest`. All 8 curated flatpaks land in `/var/lib/flatpak` before the image is shipped; ostree factory-seeds them to deployed systems on first boot. `sideral-flatpak-install.service` repurposed as forward-compat self-heal — every boot it re-applies remotes + manifest so future image rebases that add new entries install on existing user systems.
- Update cadence: standard `flatpak update`, run nightly by inherited `ublue-os-update-services`.
- Why not Helium: tried 4 ways and each broke. (1) `imput/helium` COPR: RPM packages `/opt/` itself → `/opt/helium` cpio unpack conflict on both live Silverblue host (2026-04-23) and OCI buildah (2026-05-01 attempt #1). (2) ShyVortex `.flatpak` bundle from GH Releases (2026-05-01 attempt #2): bundles have no remote → `flatpak update` can't refresh them, frozen between image rebases. (3) MarioGK community ostree remote at `mariogk.github.io/helium-flatpak/` (2026-05-01 attempt #3): the descriptor URL serves a near-empty ostree (only `summary` + `config`, no `objects/`/`refs/`/`deltas/` deployed despite workflow success), so `flatpak install` fails. (4) MarioGK release bundle install at image build (2026-05-01 attempt #4): builds clean, but the bundle's auto-generated remote points to the same broken Pages, so still no usable update path. Each Helium attempt added more packaging machinery for less working software; Flathub-listed Zen reverses the trade.

**GNOME quality-of-life (adopted from bluefin's strong-recs):** ✓ still RPM-layered
- `gnome-tweaks`, `adw-gtk3-theme`, `fastfetch`

**Shell prompt (mirrors bluefin pattern):** ⚠ moved to home.nix
- ~~`starship` (Fedora main)~~ — now via `programs.starship.enable`
- Activation no longer in `/etc/skel/.bashrc` — home-manager owns the user's bashrc.

**Mise — Pattern A (user-level install, auto-triggered on first login):** ⚠ replaced by Pattern B (nix-home)
- Image now **does ship a mise binary** in `~/.nix-profile/bin/` via `home.packages = [ pkgs.mise ]`.
- `sideral-mise-install.service` **deleted**; `sideral-home-manager-setup.service` materializes mise + the rest of home.nix on first user login.
- mise config inlined in home.nix via `home.file.".config/mise/config.toml".text = ''…''` (was `/etc/skel/.config/mise/config.toml`).
- Toolchain reduced from 15 → **12 tools**: dropped `act` (use `nix profile install` ad-hoc), `direnv` (declined entirely), `atuin` (now `programs.atuin.enable`).
- Distrobox now shares the host's `/nix` via `/etc/distrobox/distrobox.conf` auto-mount; mise itself is host-only (was host+distrobox via `~/.local/bin`).

**Fonts (adopted from bluefin's curation):** ✓ still RPM-layered
- `cascadia-code-fonts`, `jetbrains-mono-fonts-all`, `adwaita-fonts-all`, `opendyslexic-fonts` + Source Serif 4 / Sans 3 from Adobe GitHub

**Container runtime (bluefin-dx pattern — requires docker-ce repo):** ✓ still RPM-layered
- `containerd.io` + `docker-ce` from **docker-ce-stable repo**
- Rationale unchanged: user opted in despite podman; docker-ce gives seamless `docker compose` CLI

**Android tooling:** ⚠ removed 2026-04-23
- ~~`android-tools` (Fedora main) — adb + fastboot~~ — removed; use `nix shell nixpkgs#android-tools` when connecting a phone.

**Kernel debug / profiling (user override — full bluefin-dx debug stack):** ⚠ removed entirely 2026-04-23
- ~~`bcc`, `bpftop`, `bpftrace`, `sysprof`, `trace-cmd`, `tiptop`, `nicstat`, `iotop`, `udica`~~ — bluefin-dx parity items, not part of the personal workload. Reachable on demand via `nix shell` if ever needed.

**Note:** `containerd` (Fedora) is intentionally **not** listed — it conflicts with `containerd.io` (Docker). dnf handles the swap.

### Explicitly NOT layered *(historical list, still accurate for things we never added)*

- `podman-compose`, `podman-docker`, `podman-tui` — user declined
- `flatpak-builder`, `p7zip`, `p7zip-plugins`, `yq`, `sqlite`, `glow` — not needed this pass
- Bluefin-dx virt stack (`libvirt`, `qemu-*`, `virt-manager`, `incus`, `lxc`, `cockpit-*`) — heavy, redundant with podman/distrobox
- `rocm-*` — niche
- `fish`, `zsh`, `bash-color-prompt`, `ibus-mozc`, `mozc`, `samba-*`, `krb5-workstation`, `adcli` — not part of user's workflow
- `tailscale` — deferred

### Sideral specifics — current (post-cleanup)

- Build-time GNOME extension fetch: `tilingshell@ferrarodomenico.com` + `rounded-window-corners@fxgn` from extensions.gnome.org (`gnome-extensions/post-install.sh`)
- `fonts/post-install.sh`: Source Serif 4 + Source Sans 3 from Adobe GitHub releases
- ~~`devtools/post-install.sh`: mise binary from mise.run~~ — devtools dir deleted; mise comes via home.nix
- `nix-installer` binary baked at `/usr/libexec/nix-installer` (build.sh fetch)

### /etc + /usr files shipped — current (post-cleanup)

- `/etc/dconf/db/local.d/{00-sideral-focus, 00-sideral-gnome-shell, 10-sideral-keybinds}` — captured GNOME defaults
- `/etc/distrobox/distrobox.conf` — auto-mount `/nix`, `/var/lib/nix`, `/etc/nix` into every distrobox container ⊕ added 2026-04-23
- `/etc/flatpak-manifest` + `/etc/systemd/system/sideral-flatpak-install.service` — 8-app auto-install
- `/etc/os-release` rewritten with `ID=sideral`, `NAME="Sideral OS"`
- `/etc/profile.d/sideral-hm-status.sh` — first-shell bootstrap UX (poll home-manager-setup-done marker, source env when ready)
- `/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.local` — `/nix` SELinux fcontext rules (mapping to `usr_t`/`bin_t`/`lib_t`)
- `/etc/systemd/system/sideral-nix-install.service` — first-boot nix installer (multi-target.wants symlink)
- `/etc/systemd/system/sideral-nix-relabel.{service,path}` — auto-restorecon on `/nix/store` mutations (multi-target.wants symlink for the .path)
- `/etc/yum.repos.d/docker-ce.repo` — kept for `rpm-ostree upgrade` to pull docker-ce + containerd.io updates
- ~~`/etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo`~~ — **deleted** 2026-04-23 (VS Code now via home.nix)
- `/usr/lib/systemd/user/sideral-home-manager-setup.service` + `default.target.wants/` symlink — first-login home-manager bootstrap
- ~~`/usr/lib/systemd/user/sideral-vscode-setup.service`~~ — **deleted** 2026-04-23
- ~~`/usr/lib/systemd/user/sideral-mise-install.service`~~ — **deleted** in nix-home migration
- `/usr/libexec/nix-installer` — pinned binary, run by `sideral-nix-install.service`

### /etc/skel shipped (user defaults) — current

- ~~`home/.bashrc`~~ — **deleted** in nix-home migration; bashrc generated by home-manager
- ~~`home/.config/mise/config.toml`~~ — **deleted** in nix-home migration; mise config inlined in home.nix
- `home/.config/home-manager/home.nix` — single source of truth for the user environment

### Size reality check (post-cleanup)

Even **leaner** than the original surgical estimate. RPM additions to silverblue-main:43 are now: 5 GNOME extension/QoL RPMs + gnome-software + gnome-software-rpm-ostree + 4 docker-ce-stack + ~6 font RPMs + nix-installer binary stage = ~17 RPMs and ~150 MB delta over the base. Most user-facing software lives in nix profiles (~/.nix-profile) which add weight on first `home-manager switch` rather than to the image. *(2026-05-01: bazaar swapped for gnome-software + plugin; gnome-software is likely already in base, so true delta is +1 small plugin RPM minus the bazaar RPM — roughly net-neutral.)*

### Shells

Bash (from base) remains the default. No fish/zsh layered. Bashrc is now home-manager-generated; activations of starship, mise, atuin, and the nix-daemon profile happen there (see home.nix `programs.bash.initExtra`).

## 9. Window focus behaviour

**Decision:** Focus follows mouse (sloppy), no auto-raise.
**Why:** With tiling-shell, windows don't overlap, so auto-raise is irrelevant; sloppy focus gives the hover-to-focus feel without the jitter of `mouse` mode.
**Implementation:** Ship `system_files/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-sideral-focus` with:
```ini
[org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences]
focus-mode='sloppy'
auto-raise=false
```
